# Smart-Contract-Specifications
This repository details the specification of a **lab** booking, access and sharing decentralized solution using Solidity smart contracts that includes role-based access control using OpenZeppelin libraries.

---

## üß© Diamond Structure

The proposed architecture leverages a **diamond proxy (EIP-2535)**, behind which various smart contracts are deployed. This approach is chosen for two key reasons:
1.	To enable seamless updates and enhancements to the contracts without disrupting client functionality.
2.	To maintain a degree of control during the initial phases of development.

Once the diamond proxy is deployed, the account responsible for the deployment gains the ability to add other accounts, referred to as **‚Äúproviders‚Äù**. Providers are empowered to list or register online laboratories, which can later be modified, deleted, or transferred to a different provider.

Users, on the other hand, are able to reserve laboratories listed by the providers, as well as cancel any of their existing reservations. Additionally, users can access laboratories they have previously reserved, as long as the reservation remains valid. This functionality is achieved through the implementation of a new proposal: **reservable token**, which allows for the reservation of the use of an ERC721 token over a time interval, improving upon existing standards.

The implementation of a dedicated payable token, **$LAB**, through **ERC-20**, is not covered within the scope of this document. This token will be deployed separately from the diamond proxy.

The system is divided into multiple **facets**, each handling specific responsibilities:

- `ProviderFacet`: Handles admin and provider roles.
- `LabFacet`: Manages the lab entities.
- `ReservationFacet`: Manages reservations/bookings.

## üë§ Roles & Actors

- **Contract Owner** ‚Äì Holds `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. Can add/remove lab providers.
- **Provider** ‚Äì Holds `PROVIDER_ROLE`. Can register, update, delete, transfer and list labs for make them reservable.
- **User** ‚Äì Can book, cancel, or request refunds for lab reservations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements

Below, each implemented function is listed.
## ProviderFacet:

- **initialize**: Sets up the initial contract state and assigns admin roles
- **addProvider**: Grants PROVIDER_ROLE to a specified account and mints $LAB tokens.
- **removeProvider**: Removes the caller‚Äôs PROVIDER_ROLE if conditions are met.
- **updateProvider**: Updates the caller's provider information (name, email, country).
- **isLabProvider**: Checks if a given account holds the PROVIDER_ROLE.
- **getLabProviders**: Retrieves a list of all lab providers.

Since ProviderFacet extends OpenZeppelin‚Äôs [OpenZeppelin‚Äôs](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin) [AccessControlUpgradeable.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol) contract, it inherits all role-based access control functionalities provided by the OpenZeppelin library.
## LabFacet:

- **initialize**: Sets up the ERC721 token with the provided name and symbol. Initializes the labId to 0.
- **addLab**: Allows the contract provider to add a new lab with the on-chain stored metadata.
- **setTokenURI**: Allows the contract provider to set or update the URI for the file containing the off-chain metadata of a specific lab token ID.
- **tokenURI**: Returns the URI for the off-chain metadata of a given lab/token ID. Used for compliance with ERC721 standards.
- **updateLab**: Allows the contract provider to update metadata stored on-chain, including the token URI, which links to the metadata stored off-chain.
- **deleteLab**: Allows the contract provider to delete an existing lab.
- **getLab**: Retrieves the information about the lab structure (on-chain metadata) corresponding to the provided lab ID.
- **getAllLabs**: Retrieves a list with all the lab IDs.

Since LabFacet extends OpenZeppelin‚Äôs [OpenZeppelin‚Äôs](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin) [ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable.sol) contract, it inherits all the standard ERC-721 enumerable functionalities, including token enumeration and indexing capabilities.

## ReservationFacet:

- **reservationRequest**: Allows a user to request a booking for a lab.
- **confimReservationRequest**: The lab provider or authorized account confirms a pending reservation request for a lab.
- **denyReservationRequest**: Denies a pending reservation request and refunds the payment if necessary.
- **cancelBookRequest**: Allows a user to cancel a previously requested reservation and refunds the payment if necessary.
- **cancelBooking**: Allows a user or the lab provider to cancel an existing confirmed booking.
- **requestFunds**: Allows lab providers to claim funds from used or expired reservations.
- **getAllReservations**: Retrieves all reservation records stored in the contract.
- **getLabTokenAddress**: Returns the address of the $LAB token contract, set at ProviderFacet initialization.
- **getSafeBalance**: Retrieves the total balance of $LAB funds held in the contract.

Since ReservationFacet implements the enumerable extension of the newly proposed Reservable Token, as defined in [ReservableTokenEnumerable.sol](erc-reservable-token.md), it also inherits all its functions.

## üí≥ Token Integration

The project uses a dedicated **ERC-20 token: `$LAB`** for all transactions. The token is deployed outside the diamond proxy.
