# Smart-Contract-Specifications
This repository details the specification of a **lab** booking, access and sharing decentralized solution using Solidity smart contracts that includes role-based access control using OpenZeppelin libraries.

## üß© Diamond Structure

The proposed architecture leverages a **diamond proxy (EIP-2535)**, behind which various smart contracts are deployed. This approach is chosen for two key reasons:
1.	To enable seamless updates and enhancements to the contracts without disrupting client functionality.
2.	To maintain a degree of control during the initial phases of development.

Once the diamond proxy is deployed, the account responsible for the deployment gains the ability to add other accounts, referred to as **‚Äúproviders‚Äù**. Providers are empowered to list or register online laboratories, which can later be modified, deleted, or transferred to a different provider.

Users, on the other hand, are able to reserve laboratories listed by the providers, as well as cancel any of their existing reservations. Additionally, users can access laboratories they have previously reserved, as long as the reservation remains valid.

The implementation of a dedicated payable token, **$LAB**, through **ERC-20**, is not covered within the scope of this document. This token will be deployed separately from the diamond proxy.

The system is divided into multiple **facets**, each handling specific responsibilities:

- `ProviderFacet`: Handles admin and provider roles.
- `LabFacet`: Manages the lab entities.
- `ReservationFacet`: Manages reservations/bookings.

## üë§ Roles & Actors

- **Contract Owner** ‚Äì Holds `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. Can add/remove lab providers.
- **Provider** ‚Äì Holds `PROVIDER_ROLE`. Can register, update, delete, and transfer labs.
- **User** ‚Äì Can book, cancel, or request refunds for lab reservations.
