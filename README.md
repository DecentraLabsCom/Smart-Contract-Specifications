# Smart-Contract-Specifications
This project implements a **Cyber-Physical System (CPS)** booking platform using Solidity smart contracts deployed under the **Diamond Proxy Pattern**. It leverages **ERC-20 tokens** for payments and includes role-based access control using OpenZeppelin libraries.

---

## üß© Diamond Structure

Once the diamond proxy is deployed, the owner of the account that deployed it has the possibility of adding other accounts called owners. Owners acquire the main capability of list or register a CPS, which can then be modified, deleted, or transferred to another owner.
For their part, users can reserve CPSs that owners have already listed, as well as to cancel existing reservations. These users can also access the CPSs they have previously reserved and for which their reservation is still valid. The implementation of the dedicated payable token through ERC-20, called $CPS, as this smart contract is to be deployed outside the diamond proxy.

The system is divided into multiple **facets**, each handling specific responsibilities:

- `CPSAccessControlFacet`: Handles admin and owner roles.
- `CPSFacet`: Manages the CPS entities.
- `CPSBookFacet`: Manages reservations/bookings.

---

## üë§ Roles & Actors

- **Contract Owner** ‚Äì Holds `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`. Can add/remove CPS owners.
- **Owner** ‚Äì Holds `OWNER_ROLE`. Can register, update, delete, and transfer CPSs.
- **User** ‚Äì Can book, cancel, or request refunds for CPS reservations.
